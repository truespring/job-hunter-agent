To build a comprehensive, tactical Interview Prep document, I need three core inputs:

1. Your complete current résumé text (summary, professional experience, education, skills, projects).  
2. The exact role you’re targeting, including:  
   - Job title (e.g., Senior Software Engineer)  
   - Level (entry-, mid-, or senior-level)  
   - Location or remote preference  
   - (Optional but highly valuable) The full job description or key requirements.  
3. (If you have it) Any existing research notes or summary about the target company (mission, products, values, recent news).

Please share those details, and I will transform them into:

- A clear Job Overview & Fit summary  
- Tailored résumé highlights  
- Company snapshot  
- Predicted Q&A  
- Smart questions for your interviewer  
- Key technical/conceptual areas to review  
- Strategic advice on tone, focus, and red flags  

Once you provide the above, I’ll deliver the final document titled:  
“Interview Prep: $CompanyName – $JobTitle”  
with all the sections you need to walk in fully prepared and confident.
