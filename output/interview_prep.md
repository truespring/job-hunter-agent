## Predicted Interview Questions
### Technical – Go & Services
1. Describe how you’d structure a Go microservice for high throughput and low latency.  
2. Explain Go concurrency patterns (goroutines, channels, sync primitives).  
3. How do you handle errors and implement testing in Go?  
4. Walk us through profiling a Go service with pprof.  
### System Design & Distributed Systems
5. Design a Kafka-based event pipeline for booking updates.  
6. How would you scale a MySQL/PostgreSQL database for millions of requests per minute?  
7. Discuss caching strategies with Redis and cache-invalidation patterns.  
### DevOps & CI/CD
8. Outline an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for Go microservices.  
9. How do you integrate observability (logs, metrics, tracing) into your services?  
### Behavioral & Culture Fit
10. Tell us about a time you improved a service’s performance—what metrics did you track?  
11. Describe a cross-region collaboration challenge and how you resolved it.  
12. How do you align technical decisions with customer-centric values?

## Questions to Ask Them
1. Which Go microservices or modules will I own initially, and what are their main challenges?  
2. How is the Go codebase organized (monorepo vs. multiple repos) and what conventions do you follow?  
3. What are the team’s current priorities for search, pricing, or booking performance improvements?  
4. How do you measure service health (SLIs/SLOs) and handle incidents?  
5. What mentorship or knowledge-sharing processes exist for engineers new to Go or distributed systems?  
6. How does Booking.com support continuous learning (conferences, training)?  
7. How do cross-functional squads coordinate across time zones and geographies?

## Concepts To Know/Review
- **Go Language:** Packages, modules, error handling, testing, profiling (pprof)  
- **Concurrency:** goroutines, channels, select, context cancellation, sync.Mutex/RWMutex  
- **System Design:** Microservice boundaries, data partitioning, service discovery (Envoy/K8s)  
- **Messaging:** Kafka topics/partitions, message ordering, idempotency, consumer groups  
- **Databases:** SQL vs. NoSQL trade-offs, indexing, sharding, replication, cache-aside pattern  
- **CI/CD & DevOps:** Docker & Kubernetes basics, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation), Prometheus/Grafana monitoring  
- **Cloud:** AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda) best practices, cost optimization, security groups

## Strategic Advice
- **Tone & Focus:** Confidently highlight your backend wins—performance gains, uptime improvements, CI/CD deliverables.  
- **Bridge to Go:** Emphasize your strong CS fundamentals and quick learning curve. Demonstrate practical Go knowledge (small side-project or code snippet).  
- **Business Impact:** Frame technical stories around user impact—reduced latency, improved reliability, smoother deployments.  
- **Culture Fit:** Show curiosity (“Be Bold”), collaborative mindset (“Thrive Together”), and responsibility for sustainable solutions.  
- **Red Flags to Avoid:**  
  – Dwelling on frontend details—keep focus on backend.  
  – Overstating Go expertise—be honest about ongoing learning while stressing transferable knowledge.  
  – Skipping product context—link your suggestions to traveler experiences and Booking.com’s mission.  
- **Closing Strong:** Reiterate enthusiasm for scaling global travel services with Go, and your eagerness to contribute to Booking.com’s technical and cultural growth.
