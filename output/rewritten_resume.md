Please provide the following so I can tailor your resume precisely:

1. Your full, current resume text (including summary, experience, education, skills, projects).  
2. The exact job you’re targeting:  
   - Job title (e.g., Senior Software Engineer)  
   - Level (entry-, mid-, senior-level)  
   - Location or remote preference  
   - (Optional) The job description or key requirements  

Once I have those, I’ll rewrite your resume in Markdown, aligned with that role’s needs.
